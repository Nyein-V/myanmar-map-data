### **1. Executive Summary**

This repository contains the data and analysis for "The Great Displacement," an analytical brief examining the collapse of state administration in post-coup Myanmar. 
The project leverages the SAC's October 2024 census data, not as a demographic tool, but as a direct proxy for state control.

The analysis reveals a "governance gap" of **18.9 million people**â€”individuals the state was unable to enumerate. 
With a national average census coverage of only **54%**, the data provides empirical proof that state functions have collapsed in nearly half the country. 
The core finding is a story of two parallel dynamics: a catastrophic **collapse of governance in rural areas** 
(e.g., 6% coverage in rural Sagaing) and a simultaneous **consolidation of population in urban strongholds** (e.g., 130% urban coverage in Naypyitaw).

The primary conclusion is that the conflict has not just displaced people, but has fundamentally **displaced governance itself.**

### 3. Methodology & Process

This analysis was conducted at the **State/Region level** following an initial exploratory phase at the township level. 
The strategic pivot to a higher level of aggregation was made to ensure analytical integrity due to the unavailability of a reliable township-level baseline for the 2019 data.


*   **Baseline Data:** 2019 Inter-Censal Survey (State/Region level).
*   **Post-Coup Data:** SAC-collected enumerated population data from October 2024 (Township level, aggregated to State/Region).

**Core Metric:**
*   The **"Census Coverage Ratio"** (`2024 Enumerated Population / 2019 Baseline Population`) was used as the primary proxy for state control and administrative reach.

**Analytical Process:**
1.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Raw data from multiple sources was cleaned, unified, and aggregated into a single master dataset at the State/Region level.
2.  New metrics, such as the Urban/Rural Coverage Ratios, were calculated.
3.  **Strategic Analysis:** Key findings were identified by comparing census coverage across different geographic and demographic segments (Total, Urban vs. Rural).
4.  **Visualization & Dashboarding:** The final analysis was presented in an interactive dashboard to visualize the core findings.

**Tools Used:**
*   **Data Processing:** Google Sheets
*   **Data Visualization:** Looker Studio
*   **Geospatial Processing:** Mapshaper.org (for initial GeoJSON conversion)
